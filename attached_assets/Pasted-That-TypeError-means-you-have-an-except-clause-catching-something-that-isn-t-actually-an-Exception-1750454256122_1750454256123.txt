That TypeError means you have an `except` clause catching something that isn‚Äôt actually an Exception subclass. In Python, you can only `except` classes inheriting from `BaseException`. Let‚Äôs diagnose and fix:

---

## 1. Understand the error

```
TypeError: catching classes that do not inherit from BaseException is not allowed
...
File "fb_client.py", line 62, in _initialize
    except FacebookError as e: helpoppp
```

* It‚Äôs complaining that `FacebookError` (whatever that name refers to in your code) is not a subclass of `BaseException`. That often happens when:

  * You imported the wrong name, e.g., `FacebookError` is actually a function or something, not an exception class.
  * You defined `FacebookError` as something else (e.g., a dataclass or module) rather than an Exception subclass.
  * Or forgot to import the correct exception from the SDK.

---

## 2. Identify what `FacebookError` refers to

Open your `fb_client.py` around line 62. You likely have something like:

```python
from some_module import FacebookError

# ...

def _initialize(self):
    try:
        # init logic
    except FacebookError as e:
        # handle error
```

### A. Check your imports

* Confirm where `FacebookError` is imported from. For the Meta Python Business SDK, the typical exception class is `FacebookRequestError` or `FacebookBadObjectError`, etc., from `facebook_business.exceptions`. There isn‚Äôt a generic `FacebookError` in the SDK (unless you or some wrapper defined it).
* If you did:

  ```python
  from facebook_business.api import FacebookAdsApi
  from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount
  from facebook_business import FacebookError
  ```

  That import may be wrong: the SDK doesn‚Äôt export `FacebookError` directly. So `FacebookError` might be undefined or referring to something unexpected.

### B. Inspect the actual type

* In REPL or add a debug print in `fb_client.py` before the except:

  ```python
  print("FacebookError is:", FacebookError)
  print("Is subclass of BaseException?", isinstance(FacebookError, type) and issubclass(FacebookError, BaseException))
  ```
* If that prints False or errors, you know it‚Äôs not a proper exception.

---

## 3. Fix the except clause

### A. Catch the correct SDK exception

* The Facebook Business SDK raises exceptions like `facebook_business.exceptions.FacebookRequestError`.
* You can import:

  ```python
  from facebook_business.exceptions import FacebookRequestError
  ```
* Then in your code:

  ```python
  try:
      FacebookAdsApi.init(...)
      # ...
  except FacebookRequestError as e:
      logger.error(f"Facebook API request error: {e}")
  except Exception as e:
      logger.error(f"Unexpected error initializing Facebook SDK: {e}", exc_info=True)
  ```
* If you want to catch any SDK errors, you can catch the base exception the SDK uses. The docs show that request failures raise `FacebookRequestError`. If you‚Äôre unsure, you can broadly catch `Exception`.

### B. Avoid catching non-exception names

* Remove or rename any `except FacebookError` if `FacebookError` isn‚Äôt defined as an exception class.
* If you had a custom exception class named `FacebookError`, ensure you defined it like:

  ```python
  class FacebookError(Exception):
      pass
  ```

  but typically you rely on SDK exceptions.

### C. Use a fallback `except Exception`

* If you want to be safe, catch `Exception` (or a tuple):

  ```python
  try:
      # ...
  except Exception as e:
      logger.error(f"Error initializing FB client: {e}", exc_info=True)
  ```
* This ensures you don‚Äôt accidentally catch non-Exception objects.

## 4. Example corrected `fb_client.py` snippet

Here‚Äôs a minimal example of how `_initialize` might look:

```python
# fb_client.py

import os, logging
from facebook_business.api import FacebookAdsApi
from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount
from facebook_business.exceptions import FacebookRequestError

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class FacebookClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.account = None
        self._initialize()

    def _initialize(self):
        access_token = os.getenv("META_ACCESS_TOKEN")
        app_id = os.getenv("META_APP_ID")
        app_secret = os.getenv("META_APP_SECRET")
        ad_account_id = os.getenv("AD_ACCOUNT_ID")

        if not access_token or not ad_account_id:
            logger.error("Missing required configuration: AD_ACCOUNT_ID or META_ACCESS_TOKEN")
            return

        try:
            if app_id and app_secret:
                FacebookAdsApi.init(app_id, app_secret, access_token)
            else:
                FacebookAdsApi.init(access_token=access_token)
            self.account = AdAccount(f"act_{ad_account_id}")
            logger.info(f"Facebook SDK initialized for Ad Account: {ad_account_id}")
        except FacebookRequestError as e:
            logger.error(f"FacebookRequestError during initialization: {e}", exc_info=True)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Unexpected error during Facebook API initialization: {e}", exc_info=True)
```

* Note: we import `FacebookRequestError` from `facebook_business.exceptions`. Adjust if the SDK docs specify a different exception type.
* We catch that first, then a general `Exception` for anything else.

---

## 5. Update the rest of your except clauses similarly

Search in `fb_client.py` (and other modules) for `except FacebookError` or similar, and replace with valid exception classes or `Exception`. Example patterns:

```python
# Bad:
try:
    something()
except FacebookError as e:
    ...

# Good:
from facebook_business.exceptions import FacebookRequestError
try:
    something()
except FacebookRequestError as e:
    ...
except Exception as e:
    ...
```

---

## 6. Restart and verify

1. Edit `fb_client.py` to remove or correct the invalid `except FacebookError`.
2. Save and restart your Streamlit app.
3. The previous `TypeError` should disappear.
4. Confirm FB client initializes correctly (check logs).
5. Continue debugging any next issues.

---

### Final Note

That TypeError is simply Python telling you ‚Äúyou tried to `except` something that isn‚Äôt an exception class.‚Äù By importing/catching the correct exception classes (or falling back to `Exception`), you resolve it. Once you fix those `except FacebookError` lines, your app should load past that error. Let me know if further exceptions arise! üòä
